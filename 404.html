      You may find yourself living in a shotgun shack<br>
      And you may find yourself in another part of the world<br>
      And you may find yourself behind the wheel of a large automobile<br>
      You may find yourself in a beautiful house, with a beautiful wife<br>
      You may ask yourself, <em>Well, how did I get here?</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      Letting the days go by, let the water hold me down<br>
      Letting the days go by, water flowing underground<br>
      Into the blue again, after the money's gone<br>
      Once in a lifetime, water flowing underground<br>
    </p>

    <p>
      And you may ask yourself, <em>How do I work this?</em><br>
      And you may ask yourself, <q>Where is that large automobile?</q><br>
      And you may tell yourself, <q>This is not my beautiful house</q><br>
      And you may tell yourself, <q>This is not my beautiful wife</q><br>
    </p>

    <p>
      Letting the days go by, let the water hold me down<br>
      Letting the days go by, water flowing underground<br>
      Into the blue again, after the money's gone<br>
      Once in a lifetime, water flowing underground<br>
    </p>

    <p>
      Same as it ever was, same as it ever was, same as it ever was<br>
      Same as it ever was, same as it ever was, same as it ever was<br>
      Same as it ever was, same as it ever was<br>
    </p>

    <p>
      Water dissolving and water removing<br>
      There is water at the bottom of the ocean<br>
      Under the water, carry the water<br>
      Remove the water from the bottom of the ocean<br>
      Water dissolving and water removing<br>
    </p>

    <p>
      Letting the days go by, let the water hold me down<br>
      Letting the days go by, water flowing underground<br>
      Into the blue again, into the silent water<br>
      Under the rocks and stones, there is water underground<br>
    </p>

    <p>
      Letting the days go by, let the water hold me down<br>
      Leting the days go by, water flowing underground<br>
      Into the blue again, after the money's gone<br>
      Once in a lifetime, water flowing underground<br>
    </p>

    <p>
      You may ask yourself, <q>What is that beautiful house?</q><br>
      You may ask yourself, <q>Where does that highway go to?</q><br>
      You may ask yourself, <q>Am I right, am I wrong?</q><br>
      You may say to yourself, <q>My God! What have I done?</q><br>
    </p>

      Letting the days go by, let the water hold me down<br>

    <p>
      Same as it ever was, same as it ever was<br>
      Same as it ever was, look where my hand was<br>
    </p>

    <p>
      Time isn't holding up, time isn't after us<br>
      Same as it ever was, same as it ever was<br>
      Same as it ever was, same as it ever was<br>
      Same as it ever was, same as it ever was<br>
      Same as it ever was, hey let's all twist our thumbs<br>
      Here comes the twister<br>
    </p>

    <p>
      Letting the days go by<br>
      Letting the days go by<br>
      Once in a lifetime<br>
      Let the water hold me down<br>
      Letting the days go by<br>
