I led a cross functional team supporting the warehouse operations and logistical software. The system included multiple backend API services as well as android apps for staff, the team consisted of several Android Developers, a UX designer, devops and full stack and back end developers.

My main achievement was to support more than one operational location, allowing the business to expand from its first location in South London opening a secondary location in Bristol and to start planning for UK wide operations.
